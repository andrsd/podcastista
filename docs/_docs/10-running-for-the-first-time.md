When you first start Podcastista, a web browser window should open where
you need to grant the application access to your Spotify account.
If you don't do so, you won't be able to use Podcastista.

**Privacy note:** The application won't read any of your personal data.
It just needs to be able to have access your podcasts subscriptions, add podcasts into your queue and control the playback.
