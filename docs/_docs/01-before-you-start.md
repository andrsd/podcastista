***Requirement:*** For Podcastista to work, you need to have a [Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com/premium/) account.
This is what Spotify requires users to have so that applications can use Spotify's interface.

No profit from Spotify goes into my pocket.
This application is available free of charge and will always be.

Supported platforms are:

* MacOS X (10.14+)
* Windows 10 (can run on older, did not try)
